## About me

<img align="left" width="100" height="100" src="https://github.com/Hadrien-Cornier/hadrien-cornier.github.io/blob/master/images/deepdreampic.png">  Hi! My name is Hadrien Cornier and I am a machine learning engineer with a focus on pipelines, computer vision and inference at the edge.
I currently live in Jersey City (basically New York City) and I have an H1B status.
I'm interested in positions that could allow me to develop skills for automating machine learning pipelines and/or putting state of the art research ideas into production.

## Studies
I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at Ã‰cole polytechnique (France) and Data Science at Columbia University.

## Work

I've been working in startups with a focus on bringing into production/optimizing research in the field of artificial intelligence but also learning cross disciplinary skills.

After graduating in 2020, I joined a well funded stealth startup in NYC, where I have been doing end-to-end engineering on a fleet of AI enabled IoT sensors for a large US retail chain. I rebuilt from scratch the legacy data pipeline and database backend of the fleet using new streaming technologies and timeseries databases and made it capable of real-time monitoring and automated error-detection and using this tool we were able to dramatically increase the reliability of the network. I also learned to deploy automatically and package embedded neural network models using technologies like Pytorch/ONNX/TensoRT and Gstreamer/Deepstream to accelerate inference at the edge on low-power devices.

When I was at Revelio labs in summer 2019, I built a hyperparameter tuning pipeline to drive down the error of the main model from 18 to 8% using distributed computing and I worked on improving the stability and the quality of the code base, while learning about different AWS tools.

In summer 2018 I did an AI internship at the french research agency CEA in the team behind "Expressif" an interpretable artificial intelligence engine that can pick up knowledge from human experts and organize into rules. I built a library to visualize the rule database as a graph that shows correlations and conflicts so that the user can understand the decisions and prune the AI to remove counter productive rules.

I did a research internship in summer 2017 the BULL Quantum team in charge of the development of "AQASM", a operating system that mimics the behaviour of a quantum computer (running of course on a regular super computer, for now). I used Haskell to build a translator of Quipper programs into AQASM.

## Skills
Software :
  - Python (pytorch, pandas, opencv, and all the other data science stuff...) 
  - C++ (Gstreamer, NVIDIA's DeepStream) 
  - Linux

Databases : 
  - PostgresSQL
  - Time-series databases : timescaleDB, mongoDB

Hardware : 
  - Jetson Nano
  - Raspberry Pi

Cloud technologies : 
  - AWS 

## Hobbies
In my free time I love Jiu-Jitsu, scuba-diving and making small gadgets with my 3d printer
