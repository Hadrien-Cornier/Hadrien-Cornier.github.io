## About me

Hi! I'm a data scientist/engineer with a focus on vision, pipelines and edge computing.

I studied applied mathematics and computer science at Ã‰cole polytechnique and Data Science at Columbia University.

I did a research internship in summer 2017 the BULL team in charge of the development of AQASM, a operating system that mimics the behaviour of a quantum computer (running of course on a regular super computer, for now). I used Haskell to build a translator of programs into AQASM.

I've been working in startups with a focus on bringing into production/optimizing research ideas in the field of artificial intelligence but of course also helping left and right and picking up skills on lots of different technologies.

When I was at Revelio labs in summer 2019, I built a hyperparameter tuning pipeline to drive down the error of the main model from 18 to 8% using distributed computing and I worked on improving the stability and the quality of the code base, learning about different AWS tools.

After graduating in 2020, I joined a stealth startup in NYC, where I have been doing end-to-end engineering on a fleet of AI enabled IoT sensors. I rebuilt the data pipeline of the fleet using streaming technologies and made it capable of real-time monitoring and automated error-detection and using this tool we were able to dramatically increase the reliability of the network. I also learned how to package and deploy embedded AI using technologies like TensoRT and Gstreamer to accelerate AI inference on low-power edge devices.
