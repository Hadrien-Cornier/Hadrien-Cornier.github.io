## About me

Hi! My name is Hadrien Cornier and I am an AI engineer with a focus on vision, pipelines and edge computing.

## Studies
I studied applied mathematics and computer science at Ã‰cole polytechnique and Data Science at Columbia University.

## Work

I've been working in startups with a focus on bringing into production/optimizing research in the field of artificial intelligence but also helping in different areas and learning cross disciplinary skills.

After graduating in 2020, I joined a stealth startup in NYC, where I have been doing end-to-end engineering on a fleet of AI enabled IoT sensors. I rebuilt the data pipeline and database backend of the fleet using streaming technologies and timeseries databases and made it capable of real-time monitoring and automated error-detection and using this tool we were able to dramatically increase the reliability of the network. I also learned to package and deploy embedded AI using technologies like TensoRT and Gstreamer/Deepstream to accelerate AI inference on low-power edge devices.

When I was at Revelio labs in summer 2019, I built a hyperparameter tuning pipeline to drive down the error of the main model from 18 to 8% using distributed computing and I worked on improving the stability and the quality of the code base, learning about different AWS tools.

In summer 2018 I did an AI internship at the french research agency CEA in the team behind "Expressif" an interpretable artificial intelligence engine that can pick up knowledge from human experts and organize into rules. I built a library to visualize the rule database as a graph that shows correlations and conflicts so that the user can understand the decisions and prune the AI to remove counter productive rules.

I did a research internship in summer 2017 the BULL team in charge of the development of "AQASM", a operating system that mimics the behaviour of a quantum computer (running of course on a regular super computer, for now). I used Haskell to build a translator of programs into AQASM.
